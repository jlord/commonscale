### COMMON SCALE

*A blog and/or soapbox created by me, @jllord, to break down elements of the urban environment into little bitty bits.*


## MANIFESTO

I believe there are patterns in human behavior and I believe it’s not so surprising that we react predictably to our environment and that it effects us so wholly. Incredibly, as humans, we have immense control over our environment. For the most part, it’s designed and built by us - we even choose on which parts not to build and design parts to look un-built upon.

I believe things could be better. I believe better isn’t something complicated. 

This space on the interwebs will store my thoughts on urban form. My aim is to break down elements of urban form into @substackian (small) and clear pieces and create a catalogue of best practices, inherently based on human scale and behavior.

I reserve the right to edit any and all ideas at any point and I intend on using proper capitalization throughout. 

#COMMON

In the old sense meaning public and the benefit and interest of said public. 

#SCALE 

The relative size or extent of something. In this case, the city and its size or extent as it relates to the *common*.
