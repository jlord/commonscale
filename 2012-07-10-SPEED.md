#SPEED

*The closer a car’s speed is to your walking speed, the less likely you are to die when one meets the other.*

In fact, your odds of dying shrink from 85% to just 5% when a car slows from 40 mph to 20 mph. This is why the 20mph Zone inside cities movement is growing. 

## Scaling for All

Streets are safer when they’re treated as a right for all modes of transit, not just auto traffic. Many European cities have implemented laws to create these environments called Home Zone, Living Streets, Shared Space and Woonerf.

### Slowing Down

Drivers drive faster on wider and multi-lane roads, regardless of speed limit. The predicability of the open road often leads to passive driving. In some cities, signs are removed, lanes are narrowed or even curved to force drivers to slow down and be more aware of their environment. 

In urban areas with a dense street network, drivers often must drive slower because of the narrower lanes, inherit unpredictability of active streets and short block lengths.
